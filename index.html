            <h1>About Indiana City Tours</h1>
            <p>Indiana City Tours was founded in 2010 by Roger Freeman, a Hoosier and history enthusiast. 
                Growing up in Indianapolis, Roger loved to learn about his home state. 
                After spending many years working at the Indiana State Museum, Roger decided to branch off on his own.
                Encouraged to share his love and knowledge of the state, Mr. Freeman started Indiana City Tours. 
                His vision was simple: to provide engaging, informative, and fun tours that showcase the rich heritage and hidden gems of Indiana's cities. 
                Today, Indiana City Tours welcomes thousands of guests each year, 
                helping them uncover the unique charm and fascinating stories of Indianaâ€™s vibrant communities.</p>
